## Image processing framework OpenCV / EmugCV

Is done with EmugCV which  is a C# wrapper over C++ OpenCV.

Environment where algorithms can be easily tested, also comes with a collection of relevant pictures.

**Basic filters and algorithms implemented from scratch:**

* Mirror by Y axis
* Mirror by X axis
* Texture grey values
* Gaus graph
* Binomial filters
* Sobel filter
* Hough circle recognition
* Hough rectangle recognition
* Interpolation
* Similar color recognition
* etc.
